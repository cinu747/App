Final Project Readme
Cini Kolath Abraham

############ Project Summary ############
Business Domain which I selected is BIRTH REGISTRY SYSTEM where the details of every new born will be recorded in an online portal. 
This will be very much useful for parents and the hospital authorities. I found this topic very interesting as this is not a very common domain and hence, I can think differently.My entities for this domain are Baby, BabyGender, DeliveryVisit, Hospital and Parent. 
There are many relationships between the entities.
For each of my entities, there are many attributes which are related to each other such as: Baby – Baby_ID, FirstName, LastName, BirthDate, BirthTime, Hospital – Hospital_ID, HospitalName, City, Parent – Patient_ID, Father_Name, Mother_Name, Contact, Email, BabyGender – Female,Male, DeliveryVisit – Id, Dateofvisit, DeliveryTime, MotherName, DoctorName. Therefore, each requirement of the specification is fulfilled by allowing the user to login anytime and view or update their details and can make visits according to their convenience. 
Hospital authorities can view the patient visits in an appropriate way and can update as well. 


############ Design ############
o Use this section to describe the design of your final project’s functionality

The initial step is that a Parent making a visit at the hospital ( One parent can make multiple
number of visits and there for the relationship is OneToMany bi-directional). A hospital can have many
visits(OneToMany). At the time of visit, Parent will be giving the details such as firstname, lastname,
contact,email and the parent will be provided with a doctorname, patient_id, Dateofvisit, DeliveryTime(if
applicable). Therefore, all these attributes will contain specific details. If the parent is making another visit
the next day or on another date for the delivery, a baby will be born and the baby will be provided with a
unique baby_id and the attributes such as firstname, lastname, birthtime, birthdate, baby gender will be
updated. Here, the parent is supposed to visit the same hospital if a visit is required again in order to retain
the earlier records. A hospital will get a separate database for “new born” by using this web application.
Each visit of parent will be added along with the baby details and the doctor details who consulted. These
records are highly important in order to have the data for future uses such as the baby born in this hospital
requires an emergency medication after a month. Hence this application could be used by users such as
Parent – father/mother using their patient_id and thus get the details regarding the delivery. This can be
used by the hospital staff to retain the details of this patient if the parent is making a revisit after some
months or even years using the patient_id or the unique baby_id. This can also be used by the official
authorities in case of any enquiries/ birthcertificate confirmations in future. New users can use the signup button to create a new account with the system.
Multiple hospital visits can be made by the patients by selecting various types of visits such as regular checkup,urgent care, normal visit.
The appointments can be modified or even cancelled by the patients or by the hospital authorities. This is the basic functionality of this project.
Navigation:
Login page -- All users can navigate to the login page and can select "Create new user" if they are new
Welcome page -- Welcome page is the landing page with respect to each user. The information is mentioned along with the functionalities for each user to
create new visit, edit or cancel the visit, add new user, cancel the account, etc.
The admin have access to all of these.

############ Requirements (Installation, Compile, Runtime, Database, etc) ############ 

Apache Netbeans Software to be installed with JAVA 8 and JAKARTA EE 8
MYSQL Qorkbench with database ITMD4515, junit jupiter engine version 5.8.1,apache maven plugin persistence,bean validations and the payara server


############ Expected Results/Known Issues  ############

The expected outcome was to successfully register a patient record to the portal and to manage the patient visits on a daily basis. There are no issues with the application and
hence the expected results 
Working script:
Usernames – Passwords

admin – admin

parent1 – parent1

parent2 – parent2

hospital1 – hospital1

hospital2 – hospital2

The roles assigned to each authenticated user will have:
admin – can access to admin

admin – cannot access hospital, parent

hospital1 – can access to admin, hospital

hospital1 – cannot access to parent

hospital2 – cannot access to admin

hospital2 – can access to hospital, parent

parent1 – cannot access to admin, hospital

parent1 – can access to parent

parent2 – cannot access to admin, hospital

parent2 – can access to parent

(Any new user can enter username and password as they wish and can login with the same credentials)

############ Development Insights ############

This was one of the great great great courses which I took. I learned a lot about the Java, validations, bootstraps, JPA query language, annotations and lot more 
which were relatively new for me. I really enjoyed this course starting from the semester. After this course, I now decided to turn my career to Java ONLY. 
Therefore, that's the impact this course and professor had made on me!
Telling about the project, I am really happy that I was able to go along with the class and lectures so far and have a perfectly working application 
with me which I was designing for 5 months. I would like to explore more and more about the same. I would like to learn about the concepts that are missed
during the sections due to the time frame. Thank you very much professor for dealing with the issues related to this lab which I had. 
Kindly request you to consider my project since I tried my best through out this semester. There won't be any big changes with the layout. 
But, I am trying something related to this application in parallel and please understand that this project is the maximum which I am capable of and that
does not mean that I am not trying anything apart from the lecture. I have watched multiple youtube videos and also took courses and have implemented those and trying 
to implement more. The reason why so many changes are not made is because of the time challenges and stress. Hope you will understand.
Kind request to consider my future emails related to the enhancements of this same project which I am very much interested to.
